The function get_rot_bevbox in bev_vis_utils.py filters every bounding box, which is with one corner outside the image boundaries.
A lighter approach could be from https://github.com/AlejandroBarrera/birdnet2/blob/5ceed811b289796d7d7420a064ecb079c80801ab/tools/convert_kitti_to_coco_rotation.py#L113.
Here only boxes fully outside (all corners) the image boundaries get clipped to stay inside the image boundaries.

Currently in folder train/labels and val/labels are empty .txt files related to the stric filtering.
